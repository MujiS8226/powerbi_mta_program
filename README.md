# Power BI TLDP X MTA Program
This project is the result of a two-week TLDP X MTA Remote Internship Program from Baruch College, collaborated with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).
This repository is dedicated to showcasing the potential of Power BI in data transformation through data cleaning and creating insightful dashboard reports. The project uses a sample dataset from a fictional goggle company called POG, focusing on order forms for goggles. The dataset includes information such as size, color, frame, order confirmation date, delivery date, client company ID, delivery status, and a unique form number.
